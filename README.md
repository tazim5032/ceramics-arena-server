1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary software components such as the web server, backend framework, and database according to the requirements specified in our documentation.

2. **Configure Environment**: Set up environment variables, configuration files, and other settings required for the proper functioning of the server-side components.

3. **Database Setup**: Create the database schema, tables, and indexes as per the database schema provided in our documentation. Populate initial data if required.

4. **Backend Deployment**: Deploy the backend codebase to the server. Ensure that the server is configured to handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate backend endpoints.

5. **Testing**: Perform thorough testing to ensure that the server-side components are functioning correctly. Test various scenarios including user authentication, product browsing, checkout process, etc.

## Deployment

Our server-side environment can be deployed on a cloud hosting platform, dedicated server, or virtual private server (VPS). Follow these deployment steps:

1. **Server Setup**: Set up the server environment by installing the necessary software dependencies, security patches, and firewall configurations.

2. **Code Deployment**: Deploy the backend codebase to the server using version control systems like Git. Ensure that the server has the required permissions to access the code repository.

3. **Configuration**: Configure the web server, database, and other server-side components according to the production environment settings.

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Set up monitoring tools to track server performance, uptime, and resource utilization. Regularly perform maintenance tasks such as software updates and security audits.
